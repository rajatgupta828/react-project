Children is a reserved name for Props.

Suppose we want to Apply a common CSS for all the childern components, what we can do, we can create a new component :

    import './Card.css';


    function Card(props) {
        const classes = 'card ' + props.className;
        return(
            <div className = {classes}>{props.children}</div>
        );
    }

export default Card;

Then we can use that 

    import './ExpenseItems.css';
    import ExpenseDate from './ExpenseDate';
    import Card from './Card';

    function ExpenseItem(props) {

        return (
            <Card className="expense-item">
                <ExpenseDate date={props.date}/>
                <div className="expense-item__description">
                    <h2>{props.title}</h2>
                    <div className="expense-item__price">{props.amount}</div>
                </div>
            </Card>
        );
    }

    export default ExpenseItem;

Here props.childern is the one which would pass everything that is present in between that
opening and closing  tags of the custom component where it is needed.
