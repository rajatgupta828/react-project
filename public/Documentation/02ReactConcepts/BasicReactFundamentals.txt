How react Code is written :

To Create a new Rect App :
    - Install Node.js.
    - We use create-react-app , which also provide a internal server which can be used. CRA runs on Node.js. Which uses Node.js for 
      internal server and optimizations as well.
    - npm start will start the server and will open localhost:3000 to view the application.
