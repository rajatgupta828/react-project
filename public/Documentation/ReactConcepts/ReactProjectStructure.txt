- Package.json file holds all the dependencies.
- src folder contains the real code.
- Npm install will install all the required dependencies into the project.
- At the very beginning, index.js is loaded at the first, infact that is the 

index.js file   
    - Basically when we do npm start, it transforms the index.js files. Basically that's first file that will be loaded.
    - We can not import css in .js file, but in react Js files we can, that tells the server to include that CSS in entire application
    - react and react-dom libraries together basically form the react.
    - Render method is called to display the web page.
    - document.getElementById('root') is the default JS DOM object. Basically it getElementById method is called on index.html
      file that is present in the public folder and that is the main file that is loaded. That is why it becomes SPA.
    - Index.html file has only one div => root which is used by index.js file.
    - So 
        ReactDOM.render(
        <React.StrictMode>
            <App />
        </React.StrictMode>,
        document.getElementById('root')
        );
    code basically tells that render <App /> component instead of div <root> present in index.js file.
