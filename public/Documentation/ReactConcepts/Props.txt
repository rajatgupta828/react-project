- We can transfer data from one component to another component using Props.
- Components can not use data present in another components and hence we need to use Props.
- We can pass the data to another component using attributes and then later that attributes can be used to break down and used.

Syntax : 
    Syntax to pass on the Props are as below :
    <ExpenseItem title='title' amount='amount' date='date' />

Recieving Attributes values in the target component :
    When the target component is loaded, it will have 1 parameter which will be object which will hold all the data that
    is being sent to the target parameter.

    Syntax : 
        function ExpenseItem(props){   
            ...
        }
        We have named it data here, but we can name it whatever we want.

        We can then use it whatever we needed as below
